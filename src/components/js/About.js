        		<p>I grew up in a very musical household. My dad would sing Bob Dylan and The Beatles with his guitar while my mom and
        			sister would rock out to the likes of Usher. At a young age I got exposed to a blend of folk/rock classics, 90s alternative and early 2000's R&B.
        			And I loved it all. I started playing guitar when I was a small child with my dad teaching me church songs. I loved the instrument
        			immediately and started trying to emulate my dad's playing. I continued on a path of just having fun with my dad
        			and practicing occasionally, until I was about 12, and my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
        			<br/><br/>Sometimes when one reflects on their life they can notice that an event in their life of great importance
        			seems to be the catalyst for something completely unrelated. This is the case with my mom's diagnosis, and eventual
        			passing from pancreatic cancer. When I reflect on it I realize upon her diagnosis there really was a stark change in
        			my day-to-day attitudes and activities. Part of the reason was I depended on my mom for a lot of things. I had
        			spent so much time with her for my whole life that when she couldn't be present anymore there was a huge void
        			in my life. The way I instinctively chose to cope with it was to absorb myself in music.
        			<br/><br/>I was big into organized sports growing up. I quit all of them. My grades began to suffer. I made new friends, ones who had a shared
        			interest in dark music and movies. I would listen to my favorite bands so intensely I would sometimes be moved to tears. I would
        			practice guitar religiously and write songs to pour out my emotions. I was very drawn to heavy music, because it was the only
        			music that expressed what I was feeling at that time.
        			<br/><br/>When it came time to choose a college and a major, I knew what I wanted to do. Music was the only thing I felt I was good at,
        			the only space I felt confident in. I decided to attend UMass Lowell as a music education major. Some days at college felt like a new revelation. I was studying something I loved and uncovering its mysteries which
        			led to even deeper, more profound mystery and appreciation. My musical tastes began to shift drastically. I became drawn to jazz, classical,
        			fusion, and even smooth jazz and pop which I had previously detested for being too happy and corny. My taste for heavy metal slowly
        			faded away and was replaced by a taste for more playful music.
        			<br/><br/>And that's pretty much where I am with music today! Always striving to get better, and to play the music I love. Thanks for visiting my site, hope you've enjoyed it :)
